# RequestOff
Author: Steven Orsini

THE CALENDAR EXPRESS

This project is a side project of mine. It was started in early December, and was done while finishing up my semester, working, and trying to learn a 
whole bunch of new things to bolster my own resum√©. The purpose of this project is to emulate a request off software, in the form of a website. I plan to
incorporate much more features, but as of now the general idea is working, and there are no current bugs.

The languages used in this website are JavaScript, Pug (formally known as Jade) and MongoDB. These three languages work very well together in allowing me 
to create templates for pages, helping in making many pages at once, without really making any of them. This is the first time I have written a web app 
with either of these languages. I learned them all in my second to last semester of an Advanced Programming Workshop: JavaScript. Which was only a 2 credit
 course that met for an hour and 40 minutes a week. So a lot of this knowledge came from trial and error, and working overtime with my professor. The 
enviroment I use to run this application is NodeJS. The application can be started up automatically on port 6900 by positioning yourself in the RequestOff
folder, and then running the following command: 

            node mainCode.js
